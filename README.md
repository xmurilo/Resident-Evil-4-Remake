# Resident-Evil-4-Remake

<p>Knowing that Capcom's beloved Resident Evil 4 is being remade, which I've been a fan of since I was a child, I decided to create a website about the game with a countdown to the release day (03/24/2023). I will provide a preview of the website in video format and the link to access it. I will also leave the code for the countdown I found here. For now, I haven't learned JS yet, but I will learn it soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHn_rUBh2kQ">Countdown Made in JS</a> The video is in Portguese!
